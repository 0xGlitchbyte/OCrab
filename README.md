# Rust to OCaml Translator

Takes in Rust code, outputs OCaml code.

Specifically, the goal is to take in the [Rust Raw Libc FFI bindings]() and turn them into OCaml Raw Libc FFI bindings. This will allow OCaml to have a unified layer for accessing system calls.

## TODO:
- [X] modularising the code 
- [ ] Unary operations
- [ ] Binary types
- [ ] Transform variables/types to lowercase?
- [ ] Structs 
- [ ] impl blocks
- [ ] accept file as command line arg
